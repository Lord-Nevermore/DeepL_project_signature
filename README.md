# Signature Verification project
Handwritten signature verification systems are an essential part of most business practices. A significant amount of time and skillful resources could be saved by automating this process. In this project we will try to achieve it through digital image processing and neural networks.

## Dataset
Signature images, two types authentic and forged

Modality: Images <br>
Description: signatures of 30 people ( 5 authentic and 5 forged per person) <br> 
Shape: format .png <br>
Variability: offline(handwritten) <br>
Link:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/divyanshrai/handwritten-signatures <br>


## Result Details
Cosine similarity score ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating no similarity and 1 indicating perfect similarity. This score can be easily interpreted and understood by both business and social users. For instance, a business user who wants to automate signature verification may set a threshold value for the cosine similarity score, below which the signature is rejected, while a social user who wants to authenticate signatures for legal or other purposes may use the same threshold value for the same purpose.
